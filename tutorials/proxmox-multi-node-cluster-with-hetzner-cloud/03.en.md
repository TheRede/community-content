##  Part 3. Creating cluster network between Proxmox servers with ZeroTier
### Introduction
As part of this tutorial series you will get deeper in initialization of multi-node Proxmox cluster with help of Hetzner Cloud infrastructure. Whether you want to use Plex and attach 1TB cloud drive for movies and shows or setup the cluster for your business (routing, test and production environments, VMs) - you are in the right topic.

Our setup will be connected through Zerotier and include:
- Router instance - with Caddy and Cloudlare integration to secure the traffic, VPN for now;
- Dev server instance - Linux VMs and local services like API servers, Web-servers;
- Production server instance  - production services like Atlassian stack (Jira and Confluence) and other CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu LXC's.

**Zerotier** is the service provided by Adam Ierymenko as open-source project with enterprise payed features (but again, you can use it with up to 100 devices for free, and believe me once more 100 devices is a big number for even SMB). You can check details here: https://www.zerotier.com/about/

Installation instructions on one node is available at Hetzner community tutorials :
https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-proxmox_ve?title=Proxmox_VE/en

Previous tutorials:
1. Quick installation of Proxmox on the nodes with help of Rescue system
2. Initialize Proxmox node network for local containers to have internet access

Next tutorials:
4. Inialization of Firewall to secure Proxmox node
5. LXC and VM launch with Proxmox dev node
6. Installation and management of Caddy and Cloudflare as Proxmox cluster main web-proxy
7. Installing Pritunl as VPN endpoint in Proxmox router node
8. Installing Jira, Confluence and their databases on the Proxmox production node

#### Prerequisites / What we use
1. Linux desktop @ Ubuntu 19.04
2. Internal terminal (you can pop it open pressing Ctrl+Alt+T) or Termius (Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android apps)
3. Local SSH keypair

### Zerotier cluster network for Proxmox Cluster
#### Sign up and make initialization of ZeroTier
1. Create account with ZeroTier at https://my.zerotier.com/login
2. Sign in to the account and go to "Networks" in top panel.
3. Click on "Create a network" and ZeroTier will launch a new network with strange name
4. Click on the name of the network, scroll up and change name
**Have in mind that ZeroTier doesn't have save button to save changes, it simply saves it during the process, so be quick and pay attention to what you type:)**
5.  Access control will stay "Private", this means you will need to authorize all the nodes connecting to the network. It is the best way to have ZeroTier network for security means, no-one will have access without your authorization.
6.  Scroll down to IPv4 Auto-assign and uncheck the Auto-assign from Range, because we will use this network only for Proxmox instances and our devices and we better manage them manually to have easy for understanding names and ip's
7.  Scroll down to "Members", you should see that no members still available, so we do not close the page and smoothly proceed to
#### Install ZeroTier on nodes and connect them to the network
1. in the same "Members" zone you will see blue "the download page button" with this link - https://www.zerotier.com/download/, click on it
2. Scroll down and choose needed OS, in our case we are using Linux on all devices so we simply use the bash script from this page and run it in the Proxmox node's terminal:
`curl -s https://install.zerotier.com | sudo bash`
3. In case you receive error on `sudo` use simply run `apt install sudo`and run the `curl -s https://install.zerotier.com | sudo bash` again
4. You should see `Success! You are ZeroTier address [ xxxxxx ].` where xxxxxx - is the node unique id, you can use it in some cases to manually add or restore the node in ZeroTier network settings, but now we will simply connect to our network with zerotier command line tools.
**ZeroTier has its own cli tools so main commands are (join, leave, listnetworks, listpeers, status) to be used like `zerotier-cli join xxxxxx` where xxxxx - is the network id from ZeroTier network page, hope this will help you in the process when you decide to play with different settings**
5. Run `zerotier-cli join xxxxxx` where xxxxxx - is the network id, not name, from ZeroTier networks page at my.zerotier.com
6. As result you will receive `200 join OK` that means you are connected to the network, but that's not all, you should authorize this device, so we proceed with
#### Accept devices and create routes with ZeroTier
1. Login to my.zerotier.com and go to the network you created
2. Scroll down to "Members" and you will see new ONLINE device with address similar to what you had in your terminal on installation finish of ZeroTier, if you did not get a good look you always can simply check the Physical IP of the machine at the end of the row. If it is the same you want to add - let's add it
3. Click on "Auth", type in "Name/Description" and type in the ip address according to the route we have in "Advanced" zone of the page (a.e. <10.244.0.0/16> is attached to the LAN, so it is our main network), we choose <10.244.0.1> for our router instance and type this address to "Managed IPs" and hit "plus" close to input field.
4. Scroll up to Advanced/Managed Routes and add the route to vmbr1 you have on this Proxmox node like <10.10.0.1/24> via ip address you assigned in Managed IPs of the node <10.244.0.1> and click submit
**Run same steps to install ZeroTier and connect to the network to all the nodes**
#### Check the installation and ping other nodes
1. login to each node by running `ssh root@your-server-ip`
2. run `ip a` and check whether last device with ztxxxxx has ip you assigned in Managed IP of my.zerotier.com
2. ping Managed IP's of each node running `ping node-managed-ip'
3. in case of success ping routes main ip's to check that bridges created: `ping 10.10.0.1` and others

Success, you have created network for cluster!
You can connect your desktop to the same network and have it constantly connected to all the nodes.

## Conclusion
Our cluster nodes already communicate with each other using cluster network with help of ZeroTier, also we made the internal networks open to each other so by adding our host to the network of ZeroTier we will have access to all servers. 

In next step we will initialize the Firewall on all the nodes and create the cluster!

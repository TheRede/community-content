##  Part 4. Inialization of Firewall to secure Proxmox node
### Introduction
As part of this tutorial series you will get deeper in initialization of multi-node Proxmox cluster with help of Hetzner Cloud infrastructure. Whether you want to use Plex and attach 1TB cloud drive for movies and shows or setup the cluster for your business (routing, test and production environments, VMs) - you are in the right topic.

Our setup will be connected through Zerotier and include:
- Router instance - with Caddy and Cloudlare integration to secure the traffic, VPN for now;
- Dev server instance - Linux VMs and local services like API servers, Web-servers;
- Production server instance  - production services like Atlassian stack (Jira and Confluence) and other CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu LXC's.

Installation instructions on one node is available at Hetzner community tutorials :
https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-proxmox_ve?title=Proxmox_VE/en

Previous tutorials:
1. Quick installation of Proxmox on the nodes with help of Rescue system
2. Initialize Proxmox node network for local containers to have internet access
3. Creating cluster network between Proxmox servers with ZeroTier

Next tutorials:
5. LXC and VM launch with Proxmox dev node
6. Installation and management of Caddy and Cloudflare as Proxmox cluster main web-proxy
7. Installing Pritunl as VPN endpoint in Proxmox router node
8. Installing Jira, Confluence and their databases on the Proxmox production node

### Prerequisites / What we use
1. Linux desktop @ Ubuntu 19.04
2. Internal terminal (you can pop it open pressing Ctrl+Alt+T) or Termius (Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android apps)
3. Local SSH keypair

### Proxmox firewall initialization
#### Create new user to secure ssh
1. run `apt-get install sudo`
2. add user by changing xxxx to the name of the user in command `adduser xxxxxx`
3. add user to sudo group `adduser xxxxx sudo`
4. Log in in the new console to the server with new user `ssh xxxxx@your-server-ip` and run `sudo su` to check elevated rights. 
#### Make user Proxmox admin
1. Login to Proxmox node GUI, go "Datacenter" -> "Groups" -> Create -> Name - "Admins" -> hit "create"
2. Go to "Datacenter" -> "Permissions" -> Add -> Group Permission -> Path: "/", Group: "Admins", Role:"Administrator" -> hit "Add"
3. Go to "Datacenter" -> "Users" -> "Add" -> User name: xxxxx, Realm: "Linux PAM", Group: "Admins" -> hit "Add"
4. Log out from Proxmox GUI and try logging back with the new user, check if it has same access as previously root
#### Disable SSH root account
1. login to ssh with `ssh new-user@your-server-ip`
2. Elevate rights with `sudo su`
3. Disable the root account with `passwd -dl root`
4. Log out the SSH console and try logging with root, if you can't - thats success!
### Firewall configuration on Proxmox Cluster and Node level
#### Important note. Please pay attention
1. By enabling Proxmox firewall you override iptables and ufw
2. Proxmox have 3 levels of firewall with "cascading zones" that means that higher-level rules will be applied to all below, but you need to have rules enabled at all levels:
   - datacenter level
   - node level
   - vm/lxc level
3. In our experience we use mostly top 2 levels and disable firewall for vm's and lxc's because they all ride internal network ip addresses
4. Please follow the steps carefully, in case of misuse you will have to reinstall the server most of the times
5. All the changes made to your own risk, please pay attention to all the descriptions for the steps
#### Datacenter level firewall configuration
##### Create basic level rules needed by Proxmox itself
1. Login to Proxmox GUI
2. Go to "Datacenter" -> "Firewall" -> "Security Group" -> hit "Create" -> "Name": InitialSet -> hit "Add"
3. Click on newly appeared "InitialSet" and you will see that now you are able to add new rules on the right
4. Add first rule: Click "Add", set "Direction": In, "Action": Accept, "Enable": Put tick there, "Protocol": TCP, "Destination port": 3128, Click "Add"
5. Click on the created rule in the right panel and hit "copy" in the top panel, changing the port one-by-one to (all TCP):
    - 22, 
    - 111, 
    - 85, 
    - 5900:5999, 
    - 8006
6.  Add UDP rule: Click "Add", set "Direction": In, "Action": Accept, "Enable": Put tick there, "Protocol": UDP, "Destination port": 5404:5405, Click "Add"
7.  Add HTTP rule: Click "Add", set "Direction": In, "Action": Accept, "Enable": Put tick there, "Macro": HTTP, Click "Add"
8.  Add HTTPS rule: Click "Add", set "Direction": In, "Action": Accept, "Enable": Put tick there, "Macro": HTTPS, Click "Add"
9.  Add Ping/ICMP rule: Click "Add", set "Direction": In, "Action": Accept, "Enable": Put tick there, "Macro": Ping, Click "Add"
##### Enable secured rules and drop all the other traffic
1. Go to "Datacenter" -> "Firewall" -> "Rules" -> hit "Insert": Security Group -> select InitialSet and tick the enable box -> hit "Add"
2. Go to "Datacenter" -> "Firewall" -> "Rules" -> click "Add" (create new rule)  set "Direction": In, "Action": Drop, "Enable": DO NOT PUT THE TICK YET, Click "Add" and drag the rule lower than any other
3. Go to "Datacenter" -> "Firewall" -> "Options" set "Input Policy": ACCEPT, "Enable firewall": Yes
4. Go to "Datacenter" -> "Firewall" -> "Rules" and tick the "enable" box of DROP rule
##### Initialize Node Firewall (2nd level of the Firewall after Datacenter)
1. Go to "Node" -> "Firewall" -> "Rules" -> hit "Insert": Security Group -> select InitialSet and tick the enable box -> hit "Add"
2. Go to "Node" -> "Firewall" -> "Rules" -> click "Add" (create new rule)  set "Direction": In, "Action": Drop, "Enable": DO NOT PUT THE TICK YET, Click "Add" and drag the rule lower than any other
3. Go to "Node" -> "Firewall" -> "Rules" and tick the "enable" box of DROP rule
4. Go to "Node" -> "Firewall" -> "Options" set "Enable firewall": Yes
5. **Repeat with all nodes**
## Conclusion
We secured the nodes with Firewall and now all nodes added to DC will have the same ruleset. In the next step we will show how to create VM's and LXC's and what are the obstacles.
